2. THE SYSTEM THAT SCALES (3 COLUMNS OR CARDS)
- Section headline: "The System That Scales"
- Display 3 service cards (stack vertically on mobile):

  2. **Campaign Buildout & Funnel Design**  
     "We architect your Meta funnel from cold to hot — acquisition, retargeting, and retention — with a media plan tailored to your growth stage."

  3. **Daily Optimization & Scaling**

4. PROOF THAT CONVERTS
